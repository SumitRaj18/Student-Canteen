This project, Student-Canteen Management System, was developed with the assistance of Gemini (AI Thought Partner). Below is a detailed log of the prompts and AI tools utilized to build the application's features, logic, and design.

🧠 AI Utilization Areas

UI/UX Aesthetic: Crafting a high-contrast, modern "Dark & Orange" theme using Tailwind CSS 4.

Performance Optimization: Implementing IntersectionObserver for lazy-loading snack images and fade-in scroll animations.


📝 Key Prompts Used
1. Data Architecture & Debugging
"Create a React Context with useReducer that manages two related arrays: students and orders. When an order is added, automatically update the totalSpent property of the corresponding student."

2. Frontend & UI Design
"Design a SnackCard component in Tailwind CSS with a hover-to-zoom effect and a badge showing the price in a high-contrast orange color."



🛠️ AI Tools Used
Gemini 2.0 Flash: Used for code generation, logic debugging, and architectural advice.

Tailwind Play: Used for rapid prototyping of the high-contrast UI elements.
